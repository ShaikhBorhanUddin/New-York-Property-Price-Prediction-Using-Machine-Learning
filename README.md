# New York Family House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 

![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/New-York-Property-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Assets/nyc_title.png?raw=true) 

This project focuses on predicting sale prices for low-density residential family houses in New York City, specifically one-, two-, and three-family dwellings and homes. Multi-unit apartment buildings, condominiums, cooperatives, rentals, and commercial properties were excluded to ensure homogeneous pricing behavior and reliable model performance. 

## Dataset 

The original [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasciencedonut/current-nyc-property-sales) is sourced from Kaggle. For additional information on property addresses a secondary [PLUTO](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/primary-land-use-tax-lot-output-pluto) dataset is used. For consumer price index [CPI](https://datahub.io/core/cpi-us) dataset is used.
