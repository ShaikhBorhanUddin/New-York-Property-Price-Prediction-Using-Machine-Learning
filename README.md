![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/New-York-Property-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Assets/nyc_title.png?raw=true) 

This project focuses on predicting sale prices for low-density residential family houses in New York City, specifically one-, two-, and three-family dwellings and homes. Multi-unit apartment buildings, condominiums, cooperatives, rentals, and commercial properties were excluded to ensure homogeneous pricing behavior and reliable model performance. 

## Project Objective 

Accurately estimating residential property prices in New York City is challenging due to market volatility, location-based variation, and heterogeneous housing characteristics. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts family home prices using historical NYC property sales data and deploys the model as an interactive web application.

## Workflow 

## Dataset 

The original [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasciencedonut/current-nyc-property-sales) is sourced from Kaggle. For additional information on property addresses a secondary [PLUTO](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/primary-land-use-tax-lot-output-pluto) dataset is used. For consumer price index [CPI](https://datahub.io/core/cpi-us) dataset is used. 

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 

While exact sale dates contain day-level information, real estate prices vary at monthly or quarterly scales. Retaining year and month preserves meaningful temporal signal while avoiding high-cardinality features and potential leakage. 
Because adjusted sale price represents the inflation-normalized economic value of the property, it was used as the modeling target. Nominal sale price was excluded to avoid redundancy and inflation-driven noise.

## Deployment 

To access the streamlit app click the [Link](https://nycfamilyhousepriceprediction.streamlit.app/).

## Limitations 

Since the model was trained only on family house prices, the dataset includes just a subset of all properties in each neighborhood. As a result, dynamic filtering of blocks and lots is not possible in the Streamlit app. Dynamic listing can only be enabled if the dataset contains all properties within a neighborhood.
